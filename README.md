# Maze_Solver_BFS_DFS
This project implements a Maze Solver using both BFS (Breadth-First Search) and DFS (Depth-First Search) algorithms. It explores different pathfinding strategies and compares their efficiency in solving a given maze. The project demonstrates AI search techniques applied to grid-based navigation problems.
