# Maze Solver using BFS and DFS
This project implements a Maze Solver using two fundamental search algorithms:
  - BFS (Breadth-First Search) for the shortest path.
  - DFS (Depth-First Search) for exploring paths deeply before backtracking.

# 🏆 Problem Overview
Given a 2D maze, the goal is to find a path from the start to the end while navigating around obstacles. The maze is represented as a grid, where:
  - 1 represents walkable paths.
  - 0 represents walls.
The BFS and DFS algorithms explore different paths and compare their efficiency.

# 🔹 Features
✔️ Solves mazes using both BFS and DFS.
✔️ Outputs the path taken and nodes explored.
✔️ Simple, efficient, and easy to modify.

# 📂 Installation

# 🛠️ How It Works
- BFS: Uses a queue to explore the shortest path.
- DFS: Uses a stack to explore deeper paths first.
- Both algorithms return:
  - The path taken.
  - The number of nodes explored before reaching the goal.
